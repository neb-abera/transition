Here’s the contact info for an experienced resume writer at Fort Benning. She knows the ins and outs of federal civilian employment and she writes resumes. I think she charges about $80 for a regular civilian email and a federal civilian email. The federal civilian email system is much different than regular civilian one. If you send your jobs you’re interested in she will tailor your federal civilian resume to pass the electronic screening for the role

I can do your regular civilian resumes for free though so that’ll save you some money. I can also do LinkedIn’s too. I’ll send a follow up email about that

I’ll be back home in Chicago this weekend. I’ll send you the career documents I talked about which will be much more detail oriented than what can fit in a conversation. And we can zoom to talk through it. I’d especially like to demo the LinkedIn stuff since it’s much easier to show than to talk through.

I recommend reading one of the following books. They are the best reviewed quick intros to the business world, will help you understand the function and structure of most businesses, and will teach you some of the lingo they use so you don’t stand out. You don’t want businesses to think you’re entry level. What you want them to view you as is that you’re an experienced professional that is doing a career pivot into a new field. Companies tend to treat entry level folks like the Army treats initial entry privates (pay them less, treat them worse, babysit them).

This is probably the best way to break into a tech company (even if you don’t have a tech background). Incredible program. They teach you interview/resume skills and introduce you to tech companies. Their program is to get veterans, minorities, and women into high paying jobs at tech companies.

Here’s the list of preferred VET TEC providers. I’m going through the 12 week full stack engineer program through Hack Reactor (which is owned by Galvanize). Google those companies and see if what they offer interest you. They also offer free prep courses and some offer DOD Skillbridge through them

Hunter is the chrome/edge extension that gives you the job title, email, and phone numbers for employees on a company's website. I recommend adding a person that has the job you're interested, their manager, and the HR recruiters on Linkedin and start building a relationship in advance. The picture below is from the company MSG Tarver wants to work at called L3 Harris. Hunter gets you the contact info you need to "get your foot in the door."
