I made this to distribute the lessons I learned during my transition. If you're new to your transition, I recommend reading this document in sequential order of the table of contents

This is still a work in progress and isn't ready for viewing

My recommendation to get into a job in a computer science field is the folllowing

1. master the fundamentals of programming. There's really no wrong way to learn these but I recommend doing the course in python from the link below, searching youtube for any topics you don't understand out right, and then spending 30% of your time reading/watching and 70% coding.

2. take a data structures and algorithms (DSA) course. If you really want to you could take a discrete mathematics course too. I like the following books for DSA

https://www.amazon.com/Grokking-Algorithms-illustrated-programmers-curious/dp/1617292230
and if you get done with that and want more then this one

https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-fourth-Thomas-Cormen/dp/026204630X/ref=pd_lpo_3?pd_rd_i=026204630X&psc=1

3. study follow on topics that interest you or that you want to learn to work in

If you need a general roadmap and class recommendations then I recommend looking at the Open Source Computer Science

There's really no best way to learn these skills. It’s a lot of information so the most important parts I’ve found are
1. Staying organized: I had to start journaling key takeaways so that I don’t get lost, storing stuff in bookmarks, using outlook calendar etc
2. Making and sticking to a plan: it’s easy to get distracted so I found that I need accountability to stay on track. I got an agenda and forced myself to follow a daily routine, turned on “screen time” and notification limits on my phone and computer, signed up for classes that have structure, found friends online and set appointments so I had a deadline to force myself to get better by. You have your kid so that’s a good accountability buddy.
3. Learning the best way I learn: I’ve found that I learn best from textbooks and using code grind websites to solve problems (like codewars or leetcode). If you’re going to use code grind websites set a 20minute timer and try to solve the problem with no help besides looking at documentation. Then look at the solution afterwards and look up anything I didn’t know. I’ve found that I learn best by working through a textbook and then YouTubing anything I don’t understand right away. I buy textbooks because I like knowing the “why” behind stuff and I can bookmark it and reference it later. The danger with videos is that you can think you “know” how to do something by watching them. Don’t fall into that trap

You need to use sites like leetcode, codewars, edabit etc to train your problem solving and specific programming language skills. They’ll give you problems to solve based on your skill level and the language you want to get better at. They also have solutions posted and a forum to discuss stuff. It’s also fun for kids because you get a “rank” and it’s fun to level up

You then need to figure out what field of computer science you want to work in. This is important because there are countless sub-fields, programming tools/languages, companies etc. I recommend looking up the various fields and finding out what interests you. In the picture below there are countless areas of specialization in each job title.

These are my subjective opinions

-Software development: develop/maintain software products. Usually a money maker so is treated well by corporate leadership. Usually highly paid. Usually resistant to employment downturns. Requires constant study and improvement to stay on top of trends. Not every company has software engineers. The field is getting exponentially bigger and there’s a war for talent

-Information technology: a support role. keeps the electronic “plumbing” going (keep the network alive). Usually seen as a “cost” depending on the company culture. If you work at a company culture that doesn’t appreciate it they might pay IT less. Every company has IT. Field has kind of stagnated

-Cyber: your job is to protect the companies network from infiltration, or to break into the company to test their defense (blue team vs red team). Usually higher paying than IT, since it’s kind of a sub specialty that requires extra knowledge. Not every company has cyber teams. Some companies don’t value cyber until they are attacked. A growing field that is getting humongous and there’s a war for talent

You don't need a degree in computer science, IT, or cyber to get into those fields. The degree will help you get your foot in the door, make you more competitive than your peers, will probably give you skills and has taught you “how to learn” and how you learn best. Getting a degree is great and makes you more competitive, but isn’t a requirement. Once you learn how to program, probably 3 or so months, it’ll take you about 3-6 or so months to learn data structures and algorithms well enough to pass “hard” level problems on leetcode which is what the MAANG companies require. If you want a regular job you won’t even need to master data structure and algorithms. You could be employable after learning how to program.

The key thing to know is that in these fields what pays is experience. The better you’re at your job, no matter what field, the more you’ll make. The top level IT guys make just as much if not more than software engineers. The important thing is to pick something that interests you, or that you could stand doing, and the money will come.

There aren’t really any certs worth their weight in software engineering. In IT and cyber there are certs that will help since they certify the knowledge you have, but they are not a replacement for it. Certs are good for using as a study guide for what skills you need to learn though. I use to use the site below but it looks like their link broke (hopefully they'll update it). But to answer your question, it depends on what part of software development you’re interested. But generally no one cares about certs past the first software development job. Certs and degrees will help candidates get their first entry level job. After that companies just look for years of experience and what you can build for them to make them money

For jobs in computer science fields, the most important things in order of importance are
-relevant software engineering experiencing using the software stack they are hiring for
-years of experience doing software engineering
-passing the hiring assessments (usually they use sites like “leetcode” or their own assessment)

Thinking like a programmer is the most important part. Being good at googling is a skills. You should always see what the best or most recommended way to do something is. Whether you’re buying a car, looking at how to learn a programming language, or solving a coding problem at an interview.. it’s all the same problem solving system

1. Understand what the problem is asking or what you want to do (inputs, process, and output)
2. Make a plan on how you think you can do it. Try to break the problem down into easier to tackle portions
3. Try your plan and research what the best way to do each individual item is
4. If it worked look up to see if there were better ways to do it. See what the best in the field are doing. If it didn’t work then go back to step 1

That’s why no matter what route you take in programming, you’ll learn the skills. Because you use the problem solving mindset. I’ve never read this website but they say the same thing I just did

Once you learn how to program you’ll find that you need to learn more programming languages because you need better suited tools for what you're trying to do. Just remember that specialization is more important, will get you better paid, and will make you a better program. You should have one or two languages you are an expert at and then one or two that you are familiar with. I recommend learning the following languages so that you’re well rounded.

1. Python: It’s a high level general purpose language.
Pros: Its syntax is similar to English so it’s very natural to read and write in. Its very easy to create programs quickly in. There are a lot of job opportunities. It is very well supported. It is a growing language. It’s used in software development, data science, artificial intelligence, cyber security
Cons: it is a high level, interpreted, dynamically typed language so you’ll need another language if you want to work in high performance, embedded, systems programming etc. It is a “slow” language when compared to languages like “C++”

2. JavaScript: It’s pretty much the dominant language of web development. Web development is the easiest way to get into high paying software engineer jobs. Cons: it isn’t really useful for anything else. You can use frameworks to create applications using Javascript but they will be slower/worse than their native counterparts

3. You need a more “robust” or “heavy duty” programming language if you need to do work that requires serious performance or memory management. I like C++ but there’s such a wide list of languages that I’ll let you figure out what you want to pursue. At this point you’ll have already learned two programming languages so picking up additional ones will be much easier for you
