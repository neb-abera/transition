Here is an image with timeline requirements and recommendations


These are important questions to answer when making your transition plan
1. What date do you want to leave the Army? (ETS date)
2. What do you want to do after you leave the Army? Do you want to go to be employeed, pursue education, start your own company, retire etc.
3. What are your priorities for your transition? How important is moving to a specific location to you vs getting your dream job vs maximizing total compensation

I recommend completing SFL-TAP as early as possible. That's because not having a completed DD Form 2648 will prevent you from being able to schedule a Career Skills Program (CSP) internship. Retiring soldiers can start SFL-TAP 24 months out from their ETS date. Everyone else can start up to 18 months out from their ETS date.

Recommendations during SFL-TAP
1. Take it seriously, take notes, and passionately prioritize your transition
2. Do more! Get your resume reviewed iteratively, take nonchargable leave to job conferences, develop your Linkedin network, read career skills books etc
4. Tell your SFL-TAP counselor what date you want to be SFL-TAP complete so that they can plan accordingly. They have the flexibility, if there's availability, to move your appointments around so that you can be done as soon as possible.

Once you are SFL-TAP complete, and have a signed DD Form 2648, you can contact the Career Skills Program Installation Administrator (IA) and ask for the documentation to do a CSP. Look at the CSP folder to see examples of the documents you need to complete.

Key highlights and recommendations are as follows
1. The approval authority for CSPs <=60 days and within 50 miles of your installation is your Battalion Commander. The approval authority for CSPs between 61 and 180 days, and outside of a 50 mile radius of your installation, is the first commanding general in your chain of command. This can be delegated down to an O6 commander. I have heard that the MCOE CG is now the approval authority for Fort Benning CSPs.
2. You aren't limited to the CSPs offered by your installation. You can do any internship in the DOD Skillbridge network. You can also make your own. See the CSP folder to see what documents you need for that. In general, you need to find a company that will work with you, create a training plan, and get JAG and INSCOM approval. Make sure you give JAG about 30 days to review and approve your CSP.
3. Your CSP needs to start and end within the 180 day window between your ETS. I recommend that you leave 10 business days before your ETS date so that you can come back and clear the installation.
4. You can take leave before the 180 day window but you can't call it transition leave. It needs to be regular leave.
5. You can sell extra leave days back to the Army but they will be taxed at ~22% and you won't get BAH for it.
6. If you want to maximize the amount of money you get, use your earned leave before you start your CSP.
