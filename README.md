##Intro
I made two guides to distribute the lessons I learned during my transition from the Army to Software Development. I embedded links, documents, and videos. Please click on those to ensure that you understand the topic in its breadth and depth.

1. The timeline on [Sutori](https://www.sutori.com/en/story/transition-timeline--neKEiwGvCVS7veAei58G9TUT) shows everything I learned during my transition, and has helpful links and documents embedded. It answers questions about 
-the Army transition timeline including my recommendations and things I wish I had known
-general career advice like how to learn to speak civilian business terminology
-resume help
-networking and interview tips

2. There are so many incredible resources out there to help transition people into tech. But, the enormity of resources can give people "paralysis by analysis" as they try to decide which option to pick. This document below is meant to answer questions like
-how do I learn to program?
-which programming language should I learn?
-how do I transition to a job in software development, information technology, or cyber?

This is a work in progress. Feel free to make send me questions, comments, and recommendations.

##My recommendation to learn how to program

1. Learn how to search
-The most important skill to have is the ability to effectively search for the answer to your questions. The sum of human knowledge is at your fingerprints, via a phone or computer, you just need to know how to sort and analyze relevant information
-Learn to develop the skills and resources needed to utilize [google search](https://www.lifehack.org/articles/technology/20-tips-use-google-search-efficiently.html) to its full potential. I like to [use google to search Reddit and quora](https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/28/google-search-now-queries-reddit-and-quora-in-response-to-open-ended-questions/) for the answers I'm looking for. Adding "Reddit" or "quora" to your search terms, looking for the most recent posts with the most discussion, will usually filter out the spam. The most upvoted answers are usually the best. The dissenting opinions are also important to understand. 

-I do this for everything. If I'm going to learn something knew I want to know what the best way to learn it is and who the best teacher is. If I'm buying a TV I want to know what the best products are to get the most bang for my buck.

-Most of my search results are probably "best ______ Reddit" "best ______ quora"

2. Be a curious and consistent learner
-you need to develop your problem solving skills. being a good software engineer doesn't mean you know a lot of languages, it means that you are a skilled problem solver. You do this by researching solutions to problems you are facing, developing 
-Programming is just like any other skill. You're only good at what you repeatedly do. Find what works best for you to understand a topic. You should use as many resources as it takes to find the best way to make a topic click for you. You can register for online courses, watch youtube videos, get textbooks, read forums etc.

-DO follow 

-DO spend more time "doing" then passively learning how to do something. Usually spending 30% of your time reading/watching and 70% coding
Here are the most commonly suggested ways to learn the fundamentals of programming

2. Learn the fundamentals of programming

There's really no wrong way to learn the fundamentals of programming. Just pick one and stick with it. 

This is the recommended path by the Open Source Society [this Python course](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science#intro-cs), 

 I learned from doing the [prep course from Hack Reactor](https://www.hackreactor.com/prep-programs).

The most recommended intro to programming courses are 

3. Take a data structures and algorithms (DSA) course

I like [Grokking Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Grokking-Algorithms-illustrated-programmers-curious/dp/1617292230) by Aditya Bhargava. It is illustrated, programmed in Python, and intuitative. It is also a kid friendly way to teach algorithms

If you want a follow-up DSA course, or just want a more robust reference, then I recommend the [Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-fourth-Thomas-Cormen/dp/026204630X/ref=pd_lpo_3?pd_rd_i=026204630X&psc=1) textbook

4. Study follow on topics that interest you or that you want to work in. I recommend that you follow the [Open Source Computer Science Bacehlors](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science#intro-cs) roadmap until you know what you're doing. Another good roadmap is [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/python)

5. Follow talented influencers and resources

There's really no best way to learn these skills. It’s a lot of information so the most important parts I’ve found are
1. Staying organized: I had to start journaling key takeaways so that I don’t get lost, storing stuff in bookmarks, using outlook calendar etc
2. Making and sticking to a plan: it’s easy to get distracted so I found that I need accountability to stay on track. I got an agenda and forced myself to follow a daily routine, turned on “screen time” and notification limits on my phone and computer, signed up for classes that have structure, found friends online and set appointments so I had a deadline to force myself to get better by. You have your kid so that’s a good accountability buddy.
3. Learning the best way I learn: I’ve found that I learn best from textbooks and using code grind websites to solve problems (like codewars or leetcode). If you’re going to use code grind websites set a 20minute timer and try to solve the problem with no help besides looking at documentation. Then look at the solution afterwards and look up anything I didn’t know. I’ve found that I learn best by working through a textbook and then YouTubing anything I don’t understand right away. I buy textbooks because I like knowing the “why” behind stuff and I can bookmark it and reference it later. The danger with videos is that you can think you “know” how to do something by watching them. Don’t fall into that trap

You need to use sites like leetcode, codewars, edabit etc to train your problem solving and specific programming language skills. They’ll give you problems to solve based on your skill level and the language you want to get better at. They also have solutions posted and a forum to discuss stuff. It’s also fun for kids because you get a “rank” and it’s fun to level up

You then need to figure out what field of computer science you want to work in. This is important because there are countless sub-fields, programming tools/languages, companies etc. I recommend looking up the various fields and finding out what interests you. In the picture below there are countless areas of specialization in each job title.

These are my subjective opinions

-Software development: develop/maintain software products. Usually a money maker so is treated well by corporate leadership. Usually highly paid. Usually resistant to employment downturns. Requires constant study and improvement to stay on top of trends. Not every company has software engineers. The field is getting exponentially bigger and there’s a war for talent

-Information technology: a support role. keeps the electronic “plumbing” going (keep the network alive). Usually seen as a “cost” depending on the company culture. If you work at a company culture that doesn’t appreciate it they might pay IT less. Every company has IT. Field has kind of stagnated

-Cyber: your job is to protect the companies network from infiltration, or to break into the company to test their defense (blue team vs red team). Usually higher paying than IT, since it’s kind of a sub specialty that requires extra knowledge. Not every company has cyber teams. Some companies don’t value cyber until they are attacked. A growing field that is getting humongous and there’s a war for talent

You don't need a degree in computer science, IT, or cyber to get into those fields. The degree will help you get your foot in the door, make you more competitive than your peers, will probably give you skills and has taught you “how to learn” and how you learn best. Getting a degree is great and makes you more competitive, but isn’t a requirement. Once you learn how to program, probably 3 or so months, it’ll take you about 3-6 or so months to learn data structures and algorithms well enough to pass “hard” level problems on leetcode which is what the MAANG companies require. If you want a regular job you won’t even need to master data structure and algorithms. You could be employable after learning how to program.

The key thing to know is that in these fields what pays is experience. The better you’re at your job, no matter what field, the more you’ll make. The top level IT guys make just as much if not more than software engineers. The important thing is to pick something that interests you, or that you could stand doing, and the money will come.

There aren’t really any certs worth their weight in software engineering. In IT and cyber there are certs that will help since they certify the knowledge you have, but they are not a replacement for it. Certs are good for using as a study guide for what skills you need to learn though. I use to use the site below but it looks like their link broke (hopefully they'll update it). But to answer your question, it depends on what part of software development you’re interested. But generally no one cares about certs past the first software development job. Certs and degrees will help candidates get their first entry level job. After that companies just look for years of experience and what you can build for them to make them money

For jobs in computer science fields, the most important things in order of importance are
-relevant software engineering experiencing using the software stack they are hiring for
-years of experience doing software engineering
-passing the hiring assessments (usually they use sites like “leetcode” or their own assessment)

Thinking like a programmer is the most important part. Being good at googling is a skills. You should always see what the best or most recommended way to do something is. Whether you’re buying a car, looking at how to learn a programming language, or solving a coding problem at an interview.. it’s all the same problem solving system

1. Understand what the problem is asking or what you want to do (inputs, process, and output)
2. Make a plan on how you think you can do it. Try to break the problem down into easier to tackle portions
3. Try your plan and research what the best way to do each individual item is
4. If it worked look up to see if there were better ways to do it. See what the best in the field are doing. If it didn’t work then go back to step 1

That’s why no matter what route you take in programming, you’ll learn the skills. Because you use the problem solving mindset. I’ve never read this website but they say the same thing I just did

Once you learn how to program you’ll find that you need to learn more programming languages because you need better suited tools for what you're trying to do. Just remember that specialization is more important, will get you better paid, and will make you a better program. You should have one or two languages you are an expert at and then one or two that you are familiar with. I recommend learning the following languages so that you’re well rounded.

1. Python: It’s a high level general purpose language.
Pros: Its syntax is similar to English so it’s very natural to read and write in. Its very easy to create programs quickly in. There are a lot of job opportunities. It is very well supported. It is a growing language. It’s used in software development, data science, artificial intelligence, cyber security
Cons: it is a high level, interpreted, dynamically typed language so you’ll need another language if you want to work in high performance, embedded, systems programming etc. It is a “slow” language when compared to languages like “C++”

2. JavaScript: It’s pretty much the dominant language of web development. Web development is the easiest way to get into high paying software engineer jobs. Cons: it isn’t really useful for anything else. You can use frameworks to create applications using Javascript but they will be slower/worse than their native counterparts

3. You need a more “robust” or “heavy duty” programming language if you need to do work that requires serious performance or memory management. I like C++ but there’s such a wide list of languages that I’ll let you figure out what you want to pursue. At this point you’ll have already learned two programming languages so picking up additional ones will be much easier for you
