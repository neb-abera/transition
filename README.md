## Intro
I made these guides during my transition from the Army to Software Development. I embedded links, documents, and videos. I encourage you to click on those to ensure that you understand the topic in its breadth and depth. This is a work in progress so feel free to make send me questions, comments, and recommendations.

1. The timeline on [Sutori](https://www.sutori.com/en/story/transition-timeline--neKEiwGvCVS7veAei58G9TUT) shows everything I learned during my transition, and has helpful links and documents embedded. It answers questions about 
   * the Army transition timeline, things I wish I had known, and recommendations about your transition
   * general career advice like how to learn learn business terminology
   * resume help
   * networking and interview tips

2. There are so many incredible resources out there to help transition people into tech. But, the enormity of resources can give people "paralysis by analysis" as they try to decide which option to pick. This document below is meant to answer questions like
   * how do I learn to program?
   * which programming language should I learn?
   * how do I transition to a job in software development, information technology, or cyber?

   Here is a good intro video from [Andy Sterkowitz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueXjGMrmn8k) on some of the topics I will cover below.

## My recommendation on how to learn to program

1. Learn the fundamentals of programming

   There's really no wrong way to learn the fundamentals of programming. Just pick one and stick with it. I'm going to list three that I recommend for you to chose from
   
   * [Open Source Society's Intro to Programming and Intro to Computer Science](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science#intro-cs) I think this is a good program and what I would recommend to people with no programming experience. It has a beginner friendly structure, is taught in Python, and has a good roadmap for future topics. Make sure you do the exercuses, problem sets, etc. It's easy to think you can learn from just watching the videos.. you can't. You learn by doing things repeatedly
   
   * [The prep course from Hack Reactor](https://www.hackreactor.com/prep-programs): This is what I used. This is a good alternative to the first course. I think prep courses from bootcamps are valuable because these comapnies know how to teach beginners to become software developers. They do what they know works. I also believe that the repitition they provide is essential to the learning process. This program forces you to get the repititions in. There is some instruction, you try stuff on your own, and then there's a video to watch if you get lost and need help. It is taught in JavaScript so it's only useful if you'd like to learn or work in web development.

   * [Harvard's CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/): It's an incredible course, but I don't think it's for a beginner with no prior experience. You should pick this if you're ambitious, or have prior experience. I don't get how it's so highly regarded for beginners on reddit. Most beginnners will struggle with week 5 and beyond in this course. The course escalates quickly, includes data structures and algorithms (DSA), and uses a variety of languages. It's like a buffet of topics and I'm not sure if most people will leave the course confident in any of the languages they cover. However, it has the best instruction, resources, and subjects if you are a dedicated student.

   ### How can small kids learn programming
   
   If you have small kids then I recommend getting them to try [codecombat](https://codecombat.com/) and [scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/). You can graduate them to the recommendations above when they're ready. The tough part of teaching kids is keeping them engaged and focused on one task for a set period of time. These websites try to make the learning process fun for kids. So, I think they are worth a shot. 

2. Include dedicated coding and problem solving training in your schedule (daily repitition is best) 
      
   I recommend [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) if you're a beginner. They’ll give you problems to solve based on your skill level and the language you want to get better at. They also have solutions posted and a forum to discuss stuff. It’s also fun for kids because you get a “rank” and it’s fun to level up.
      
   I recommend setting aside 5x60 minutes sessions a week to this. This is my methodology for training
      
      1. set a clock for 20 minutes
      2. try to solve the problem with limited use of documentatation
      3. compare my solution to other solutions provided
      4. if there's a significantly better way to solve the problem then I learn that pattern.
      5. Redo the problem until I can do it with no documentation or outside assistance
      6. find a different problem and restart this process until I'm done with the training session

   You need to use sites like [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) (great for beginners to rank up), [Edabit](https://edabit.com/) (has a lot of good problems to practice, but lacks the structure of codewars and I used up the free trial in like two days), and [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) (you'll need to finish a DSA course before you'll be able to solve most of the problems) to train your problem solving and programming language specific skills.
   
   ### How do I set my computer up for programming
   
   Use [repl.it](repl.it) to practice in if you're intimidated by setting up a text editor or integrated development environment.
   
   The intro material you choose will give you instructions on what they recommend to do for set-up. Here is a list of [common text editors and integrated development environments (IDEs)](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/tools)
   
   I like to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with a whole host of extensions such as [these](https://www.google.com/search?q=visual+studio+code+extensions+reddit&sxsrf=ALiCzsZjFzulwX0oGGxnimjVpOUIIj0ErA%3A1665338511638&ei=jwxDY8KdJsyh5NoPubiF4A8&ved=0ahUKEwiCoaqz3dP6AhXMEFkFHTlcAfwQ4dUDCA4&uact=5&oq=visual+studio+code+extensions+reddit&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyBQgAEIAEMgYIABAeEBYyBggAEB4QFjIFCAAQhgMyBQgAEIYDMgUIABCGAzIFCAAQhgM6CggAEEcQ1gQQsAM6BwgAELADEEM6DQguEMcBENEDELADEEM6DQgAEOQCENYEELADGAE6BAgAEENKBAhNGAFKBAhBGABKBAhGGAFQ3gpYihhggRloAXABeACAAV-IAbAEkgEBN5gBAKABAcgBEcABAdoBBggBEAEYCQ&sclient=gws-wiz)

2. Take a data structures and algorithms (DSA) course

   I recommend getting [Grokking Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Grokking-Algorithms-illustrated-programmers-curious/dp/1617292230) by Aditya Bhargava and pairing that with [structy](structy.net). The book is illustrated, programmed in Python, and intuitative. Structy provides video instruction and an environment to code DSA in Python, JavaScript, and C++.
   
   I think that DSAs should be taught in a seperate course from an intro to programming course. I think people should be comforable with the fundamentals of programming in one language before they give bandwidth to DSA. 
  
   If you want a follow-up DSA text, or just want a more robust reference, then I recommend the [Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-fourth-Thomas-Cormen/dp/026204630X/ref=pd_lpo_3?pd_rd_i=026204630X&psc=1) textbook
   
3. Learn to think like a programmer

   Thinking like a programmer is the most important part part of learning to program. That’s why no matter what route you take in programming, you’ll learn the skills of a programmer. That's because memorizing programming lanague syntax does not make you a programmer, applying the problem solving mindset is what makes you a programmer.
   
   My personal methodology is 
      1. Read and understand what the problem is asking (inputs, process, and output)
      2. Make a plan on how you think you can do it. Try to break the problem down into easier to tackle portions
      3. Try your plan and research what the best way to do each individual item is
      4. If it worked look up to see if there were better ways to do it. See what the best in the field are doing. If it didn’t work then go back to step 1

   [Andy Harris has a long, but thorough, video on this topic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azcrPFhaY9k). You can also search for other videos on the topic. Don't feel compelled to watch the video, you can always come back to it.
   
    I had never read this website, until I made this document, but they say the same thing I just did

   https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2/

4. Learn how to search

   You need to learn how to effectively search for the answer to your questions. The sum of human knowledge is at your fingerprints, via a phone or computer, you just need to know how to sort and analyze relevant information. Being good at googling is a skill you should develop. You should always see what the best or most recommended way to do something is. Whether you’re buying a car, looking at how to learn a programming language, or solving a coding problem at an interview.. it’s all the same problem solving skill.

   There are different ways of using [google search](https://www.lifehack.org/articles/technology/20-tips-use-google-search-efficiently.html) to its full potential. I like to [use google to search Reddit and quora](https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/28/google-search-now-queries-reddit-and-quora-in-response-to-open-ended-questions/) for the answers I'm looking for. Adding "Reddit" or "quora" to your search terms, looking for the most recent posts with the most discussion, will usually filter out the spam. The most upvoted answers are usually the best. The dissenting opinions are also important to understand. 

   Most of my search results on any given day are probably "best ______ Reddit" "best ______ quora"

5. Be a curious and consistent learner

   Continue to develop your problem solving skills, and study follow on topics that interest you or that you want to work in. 
   
   Programming is just like any other skill. You're only good at what you repeatedly do. Find what works best for you to understand a topic. You should use as many resources as it takes to find the best way to make a topic click for you. You can register for online courses, watch youtube videos, get textbooks, read forums etc.
   
   I recommend that you follow roadmaps like [Open Source Computer Science Bacehlors](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science#intro-cs) roadmap until you know what you're doing. Another good roadmap is [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/python)

   AVOID PASSIVE "LEARNING" - This is one of the most common mistakes people make when they try to learn programming. You should spend more time "doing" then passively learning how to do something. Usually spending <=30% of your time reading/watching and >=70% coding
   
   Here are two videos on mistakes beginners make. The first is from [Aaron Jack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7aSI-E1fCE) and the second is a video from [William Lin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVKHRtafgPc) on competitive programming but the principles still apply.

6. Follow talented content producers

   Here are some of my favorite content producers
   
   * Clement Mihailescu on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaO6VoaYJv4kS-TQO_M-N_g). He went from having never coded to getting hired at google in 6 months. He also owns [AlgoExpert](algoexpert.io).
   * Alexander Nguyen on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alxngu/) and [Medium](https://alexcancode.medium.com/). He is a talented software engineer that publishes about how to get hired at tech companies
   * freeCodeCamp - Tons of free courses and videos on their [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/Freecodecamp) and [website](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
   * Alvin Zablan on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/AlvintheProgrammer). He is my favorite instructor on freeCodeCamp.org and he also owns [structy.net](structy.net)

## Additional advice

   There's really no best way to learn software development. It’s a wide field, with tons of sub-fields, and lot of information. Here are some important tips I’ve found
   1. Staying organized: I had to start journaling key takeaways so that I don’t get lost, storing stuff in bookmarks, using outlook calendar etc
   2. Making and sticking to a plan: it’s easy to get distracted so I found that I need accountability to stay on track. I got an agenda and forced myself to follow a daily routine, turned on “screen time” and notification limits on my phone and computer, signed up for classes that have structure, found friends online and set appointments so I had a deadline to force myself to get better by. You have your kid so that’s a good accountability buddy.
   3. Learning the best way I learn: I’ve found that I learn best from textbooks and using code grind websites to solve problems (like codewars or leetcode). If you’re going to use code grind websites set a 20minute timer and try to solve the problem with no help besides looking at documentation. Then look at the solution afterwards and look up anything I didn’t know. I’ve found that I learn best by working through a textbook and then YouTubing anything I don’t understand right away. I buy textbooks because I like knowing the “why” behind stuff and I can bookmark it and reference it later. The danger with videos/books is that you can think you “know” how to do something by watching them. Don’t fall into that trap

   You then need to figure out what field of computer science you want to work in. This is important because there are countless sub-fields, programming tools/languages, companies etc. I recommend looking up the various fields and finding out what interests you. In the picture below there are countless areas of specialization in each job title.

   https://lensdump.com/i/iHcJHP

## My subjective opinion on working in three popular areas in tech (software development, IT, cyber)

1. Software development: develop/maintain software products. Usually a money maker so is treated well by corporate leadership. Usually highly paid. Usually resistant to employment downturns. Requires constant study and improvement to stay on top of trends. Not every company has software engineers. The field is getting exponentially bigger and there’s a war for talent

2. Information technology: a support role. keeps the electronic “plumbing” going (keep the network alive). Usually seen as a “cost” depending on the company culture. If you work at a company culture that doesn’t appreciate it they might pay IT less. Every company has IT. Field has kind of stagnated

3. Cyber: your job is to protect the companies network from infiltration, or to break into the company to test their defense (blue team vs red team). Usually higher paying than IT, since it’s kind of a sub specialty that requires extra knowledge. Not every company has cyber teams. Some companies don’t value cyber until they are attacked. A growing field that is getting humongous and there’s a war for talent

For jobs in computer science fields, the most important things in order of importance are
   -relevant software engineering experiencing using the software stack they are hiring for
   -years of experience doing software engineering
   -passing the hiring assessments (usually they use sites like “leetcode” or their own assessment)

You don't need a degree in computer science, IT, or cyber to get into those fields. The degree will help you get your foot in the door, make you more competitive than your peers, will probably give you skills and has taught you “how to learn” and how you learn best. Getting a degree is great and makes you more competitive, but isn’t a requirement. Once you learn how to program, probably 3 or so months, it’ll take you about 3-6 or so months to learn data structures and algorithms well enough to pass “hard” level problems on leetcode which is what the MAANG companies require. If you want a regular job you won’t even need to master data structure and algorithms. You could be employable after learning how to program.

The key thing to know is that in these fields what pays is experience. The better you’re at your job, no matter what field, the more you’ll make. The top level IT guys make just as much if not more than software engineers. The important thing is to pick something that interests you, or that you could stand doing, and the money will come.

There aren’t really any certs worth their weight in software engineering. In IT and cyber there are certs that will help since they certify the knowledge you have, but they are not a replacement for it. Certs are good for using as a study guide for what skills you need to learn though. I use to use the site below but it looks like their link broke (hopefully they'll update it). But to answer your question, it depends on what part of software development you’re interested. But generally no one cares about certs past the first software development job. Certs and degrees will help candidates get their first entry level job. After that companies just look for years of experience and what you can build for them to make them money

## How do I get a technical job in the tech industry as a veteran or service member

   I recommend that service members or veterans use [VET TEC](https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/how-to-use-benefits/vettec-high-tech-program/) to attend coding bootcamps. They will upskill you and have connections on technical job placement. Service members and veterans should also apply for [BreakLine](https://breakline.org/). BreakLine's purpose is to help veterans, minorities, and women get into high paying tech roles. This is the best way to get a tech job.
   
   Remember that depending on the company, you will likely have to pass technical assessments to get a job offer.
   
## How do to pass a technical assessment or interview

   This level of preparation is probably overkill for most roles at most companies. However, it's good to expose yourself to what the top level companies expect for technical interviews
   
   * An article from Alex Nguyen on the resources he uses to prepare for technical interviews [here](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/how-i-got-in-to-amazon-microsoft-google-all-from-studying-these-resources-31724508ce0e) and 
   * An article from Alex Nguyen on his system for solving problems in technical interviews [here](https://alexcancode.medium.com/the-coding-interview-formula-that-will-get-you-any-faang-maang-offer-45e71a3681e7) are a great guide.
   * A video from Clement Mihailescu on technical interviews [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QxUp8MwbWw)
   * A video from Clement Mihailescu on the most important concepts for technical interviews [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ge0Udbws1kc)
   * [AlgoExpert](algoexpert.io) may help with DSA problems prep for technical interviews. I haven't tried it yet so I can't give my personal recommendation for it. I've heard it is a great product but lacks in some of the more advanced topics. I'll give it a try when I get ready for technical interviews in about 6 months.
   
## What programming languages should you learn
   
   Once you learn your first programming language, you’ll find that you need to learn more programming languages because you need better suited tools for what task you're trying to accomplish. Just remember that specialization is more important, will get you better paid, and will make you a better program. You should have one or two languages you are an expert at, and then one or two that you are familiar with. I recommend learning the following languages so that you’re well rounded.

1. Python: a high level general purpose language.
   
   Pros: Its syntax is similar to English so it’s very natural to read and write in. Its very easy to create programs quickly in. There are a lot of job opportunities. It is very well supported. It is a growing language. It’s used in software development, data science, artificial intelligence, cyber security
   
   Cons: it is a high level, interpreted, dynamically typed language so you’ll need another language if you want to work in high performance, embedded, systems programming etc. It is a “slow” language when compared to languages like “C++”

2. JavaScript: the dominant language of web development (only if you're interested in web development or a coding bootcamp)
   
   Web development is the easiest way to get into high paying software engineer jobs. Cons: it isn’t really useful for anything else. You can use frameworks to create applications using Javascript but they will be slower/worse than their native counterparts

3. Other languages
   
   You need a more “robust” or “heavy duty” programming language if you need to do work that requires serious performance or memory management. I like C++ but there’s such a wide list of languages that I’ll let you figure out what you want to pursue. At this point you’ll have already learned two programming languages so picking up additional ones will be much easier for you

## What resources have I personally purchased or used

### What Python resources have I personally purchased or used

   Go to [pythonbooks](https://pythonbooks.org/for-programming-beginners/) to see a breakdown of highly rated books by skill level and topic

   * [Learning Python, 5th Edition](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-python-5th/9781449355722/) I love a good textbook. This is no longer updated though
   * [Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/#toc) Their method is to teach you the basics quickly and then throw you into building projects.

I come back to this when I want to learn useful skills and projects
   * [Fluent Python](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fluent-python-2nd/9781492056348/) I haven't gotten to this yet. It came highly recommended so I can't wait to tackle it after I graduate from Hack Reactor
